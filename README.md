## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€

## The Experience:

It was an amalgam of fun and frustration. At moments when I couldn't get the exact padding required or my components were running all over the page. But the pride I felt and the things I learned during the process made it worth it!
